# 🧠 Eye Disease Classification Using Deep Learning

## 📍 Project Summary

This project presents a deep learning approach to **automatically classify retinal images** into four categories:

- **Glaucoma**
- **Cataract**
- **Normal**
- **Diabetic Retinopathy**

Using **transfer learning with the VGG19 CNN architecture**, the model achieves high accuracy and robust performance on unseen data. This solution demonstrates the power of AI in supporting early detection of eye diseases — a critical task in healthcare diagnostics.
